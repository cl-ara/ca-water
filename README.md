# Clean Water Accessibility in California

Safe drinking water is essential to ensuring public health and preventing the spread of infectous diseases like cholera and typhoid. However, despite huge progress made in improving the safety of water, many water systems and schools in California today fail to meet safety criteria upheld by the State Water Board's Human Right to Water Resolution that recognized the human right to safe, clean, affordable, and accessible water.

In a social epidemiologial study conducted in 2005-2010, scientists found an association between socioeconomic and environmental factors that place socially-disadvantaged communities at greater risk of exposure to contaminated drinking water. 

This exploratory analysis examines the associations between poverty and unsafe drinking water systems/water safety violations in current day California.
